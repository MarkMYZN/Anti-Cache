# Anti-Cache
It clears/removes Caches in your Windows 10 Computer. (it probably works in Windows 11 too I don't know)

I created this software with the idea of helping people with slowing down / slow computers. And also for my pc's good as well.

If run, it will optimize, clean, refresh, and repair missing or corrupted files in your computer.

Make sure to run it as Administrator, And please proceed with caution.



# How to use:

1. Download the Application Here:
https://github.com/MarkMYZN/Anti-Cache/releases

2. Select "Anti-Cache.exe"

3. Place the exe to anywhere you want to execute it.

4. Right-click the file and run as Admin, which requires administrative privileges for the commands to work.

5. DO NOT exit the application (unless you accidentally clicked on it), It will automatically shutdown the computer.

6. After shutdown, you can now start-up again your computer.

7. And Boom! Your computer will be smooth and fast again.
